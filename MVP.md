# 🧭 OmegaTrader MVP Roadmap

As I progress along this jounrey I will also be learning what these concepts in finance are along the implemenation in C++

## ✅ Stage 1: Core Order Book
📌 *Foundation of everything: no matching yet, just clean storage.*

- Define an `Order` (ID, side, price, quantity)
- Build the data structure to store orders
  - Buy side: sorted descending
  - Sell side: sorted ascending
- Add orders and print the current state

**🔍 Learn**: `std::map`, `std::vector`, enums, file structure

---

## 🟡 Stage 2: Matching Engine
📌 *Simulates how exchanges match incoming orders against the book.*

- Match buy/sell orders when prices cross
- Handle partial fills, remove filled orders

**🔍 Learn**: iterators, control flow, exchange logic

---

## 🔵 Stage 3: Order Lifetime & Memory Management
📌 *Track and manage order lifetimes using smart pointers.*

- Use `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`
- Ensure safe object lifetime and ownership

**🔍 Learn**: RAII, smart pointers, memory safety

---

## 🟣 Stage 4: Strategy & Backtesting Engine
📌 *Simulate trading strategies on historical data.*

- Write a sample strategy (e.g., moving average)
- Feed in tick or OHLC data
- Track PnL and positions

**🔍 Learn**: abstraction, templates, callbacks

---

## 🔴 Stage 5: Multithreading & Market Data Feed
📌 *Simulate real-time data using threads.*

- Separate thread for market data
- Feed updates to strategy/engine
- Use `std::thread`, `mutex`, `atomic`, `condition_variable`

**🔍 Learn**: concurrency, thread safety, producer-consumer

---

## ⚫ Stage 6: Lock-Free Performance Layer
📌 *Write ultra-fast queues without mutexes.*

- Lock-free ring buffer or SPSC queue
- Replace mutexes for data passing

**🔍 Learn**: atomics, memory ordering, lock-free design

---

## ⚪ Stage 7: Plugin System for Strategies
📌 *Make your engine modular and extensible.*

- Interface/base class for strategy modules
- Load/execute strategy dynamically
- Use templates or polymorphism

**🔍 Learn**: interface design, type erasure, clean API

---

## 🟤 Stage 8: Risk Engine
📌 *Limit trading based on risk exposure.*

- Position limits, capital allocation checks
- Risk rule validation before trades

**🔍 Learn**: constraints, graph dependencies, observer pattern

---

## 🟠 Stage 9: Monitoring & Logging
📌 *Track engine activity and performance.*

- Log trades, PnL, order events
- Use `spdlog` or write to files with timestamps

**🔍 Learn**: logging, `chrono`, perf tracking

---

## 🧪 Final Step: Cleanup & Docs
📌 *Make your project clean and showcase-ready.*

- Add a `README.md` with diagrams and examples
- Include sample output or screenshots
- Add simple unit tests

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- STL containers: `map`, `vector`, `unordered_map`
- Memory management: `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`
- Templates and CRTP
- Multithreading and synchronization
- Lock-free programming
- RAII and design patterns
- Unit testing and logging
- CMake and project organization
